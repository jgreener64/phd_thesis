## TODO

- Ernesto Cota corrections:
  - p. 14 – "allosteric mechanisms remain an enigma and a universal mechanism has not been found". Given the diversity of protein structures, do you expect to find a universal mechanism? Rephrase sentence?
  - p. 21 – "Fpocket uses the concepts of Voronoi tessellation". Describe briefly what is Voronoi tessellation.
  - p. 35 – "CDK2 crystallised with an ATP-binding site inhibitor". Which inhibitor? Mark in the figure the position of the ANS and the inhibitor.
  - p. 100 – "0.1M NaHCO3 was incubated overnight with Cy5...". Is that 0.1M NaHPO3? Or sodium phosphate buffer instead, at what pH?
  - p. 100 – "CDK2 titration a 392mL/well plate was used". Not clear, rephrase please.
  - p. 100 – "Each well contained 1nM cyclin...". Reaction volume and which phosphate buffer, at what pH?
  - p. 100 – "A control with no CDK2... each wellbeing a three-fold dilution for a lowest concentration of 50pM". Put the actual concentrations you used.
  - p. 101 – "20 repeats were taken for each reading...". 2 or 20 readings?
  - p. 105 – "The LeadsNow subset is clustered using a 50% Tanimoto cutoff". Describe the Tanimoto cutoff.
