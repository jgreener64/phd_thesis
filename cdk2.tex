\chapter{CDK2}
\label{cha:cdk2}

This chapter describes computational and experimental work to test a potential allosteric site on cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), a protein important in cell cycle regulation.
This allosteric site was predicted by ExProSE in Section~\ref{sec:exprose_results}.
A virtual screen of small molecules was carried out against the pocket.
Selected molecules were purchased and tested using two experimental assays to see if they could inhibit the interaction between CDK2 and cyclin A2.


\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:cdk2_methods}


\subsection{Bioinformatics resources}

FTMap \cite{Kozakov2015}, the Fragment Hotspot Map \cite{Radoux2016}, ResiCon \cite{Dziubinski2016} and the DynOmics server \cite{Li2017} were run with default settings using the ANS-bound structure (PDB ID 3PXF) as input.


\subsection{Virtual screening}

AutoDock Vina and DOCK were run in line with the respective documentation.
ChemMine clustering of structures used binning clustering at a similarity cutoff of 0.5.
The highest ranked by docking scores was retained in each case.

The ExProSE structures selected with an open pocket have the maximum sum of two distances across the opening of the pocket: the distance between atom OH on residue TYR180 and atom NH1 on ARG150, and the distance between atom OG on residue SER188 and atom O on THR165.
These structures are energy minimised as described in Section~\ref{sec:exprose_methods} to remove any violations of stereochemistry.


\subsection{Reagents and compounds}

The buffers and media used for experimental work were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Auto-induction media: 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5052, NPS, 1 M MgSO$_{4}$, Ampicillin.
\item Lysogeny broth: 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl.
\item Lysis buffer: 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl$_{2}$, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, Triton.
\item Phosphate buffer: 100 mM phosphate pH 8.0.
\item Tris pH 8 buffer: 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl$_{2}$.
\item TBS-T buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1\% Tween 20.
\item Transfer buffer: 20\% methanol, 190 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Purification of cyclin A2}

The plasmid for cyclin A2 with either a His tag or GST tag (source - David J Mann unpublished) was transformed into \textit{E.\ coli} Tuner cells.
Various conditions for growth were tried in auto-induction media and lysogeny broth, similar to the approach in \cite{Wang2007}.
The final conditions used for His-tagged cyclin A2 were growth of cultures at 37$^{\circ}$C until optical density in auto-induction media, then incubation at 18$^{\circ}$C for 40 hours.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 5,000 rpm).
Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer with 0.5 mg ml$^{-1}$ lysozyme.
After sonication and centrifugation (30 min at 16,000 rpm) the supernatant was incubated on Ni Sepharose Fast Flow beads in lysis buffer for 1 hour.
After washing the beads, cyclin A2 was eluted with 500 mM imidazole in lysis buffer, dialysed into lysis buffer and stored at -20$^{\circ}$C in 50\% glycerol.


\subsection{TR-FRET assay}

To label CDK2 with Cy5 dye, CDK2 (source - Gregory Craven unpublished, 10 mg/ml) in 0.1 M NaHCO$_{3}$ was incubated overnight with Cy5 NHS ester dye in anhydrous DMF.
Excess dye was removed by gel filtration in phosphate buffer with the fractions containing CDK2 identified by fluorescent SDS-PAGE.

For the time-resolved F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) CDK2 titration a 392 \textmu L/well plate was used.
Each well contained 1 nM cyclin A2-His, 1 nM Eu-anti-His antibody and CDK2 at various concentrations in 50\% glycerol/50\% phosphate buffer.
A control with no CDK2 and 10 CDK2 concentrations were used, with a highest concentration of 1 \textmu M and each well being a three-fold dilution for a lowest concentration of 50 pM.
The plate was incubated for 1 hour and centrifuged at 800 rpm before being read.
20 repeats were taken for each reading and the values averaged.


\subsection{Binding assay}

His-tagged cyclin A2 (75 nM) was incubated on Ni Sepharose Fast Flow beads in Tris pH 8 buffer with 12\% DMSO.
CDK2 (source - Gregory Craven unpublished) was added (8 nM) along with compounds in 5 concentrations: 0 M control, 8 \textmu M, 40 \textmu M, 200 \textmu M and 1 mM.
After incubation for 1 hour the beads were washed with Tris pH 8 buffer and heated in gel-loading dye at 100$^{\circ}$C for 10 minutes to release bound protein.
The proteins in the supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting in transfer buffer for 1 hour at 100 V.
The membrane was incubated for 15 minutes in TBS-T buffer with 1.5\% skimmed milk powder.
The primary antibody, CDK2 rabbit polyclonal antibody was added and the membrane incubated overnight at 4$^{\circ}$C.
After washing with TBS-T buffer the secondary antibody was added and incubation for 1 hour carried out.
The membrane was washed with TBS-T buffer and imaged with chemiluminescence by adding ECL dye and using a 1 s exposure.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:cdk2_results}

Having predicted a new allosteric site on CDK2 using ExProSE, we wished to explore this pocket further computationally and test experimentally whether it was in fact an allosteric site.
Section~\ref{sec:exprose_results} and Figure~\ref{fig:cdk2_exprose} describe how ExProSE predicts the third predicted pocket, henceforth referred to as the pocket of interest, as being allosteric.
See Figure~\ref{fig:cdk2_intro} for the structural elements of CDK2.
This pockets are also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cdk2_structure}A.
The pocket of interest is close to the region of cyclin binding, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cdk2_structure}B with the non-crystallised portion of cyclin A2 modelled with Phyre2 \cite{Kelley2015}.

This pocket is not open in the apo CDK2 structure (PDB ID 1HCL) or in the cyclin A2-bound structure (PDB ID 1FIN).
In the cyclin A2-bound structure there is in fact a protrusion instead of a pocket opening, suggesting that a small molecule would not be able to bind the pocket at the same time as cyclin A2 is bound to CDK2.
The pocket is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cdk2_structure}C in various structures where it is open.
The residues that make up the pocket are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cdk2_structure}D.
The pocket is open but small in the structure with two ANS molecules bound in the known allosteric site (PDB ID 3PXF), with a size of 45 \AA$^{3}$ predicted by LIGSITE\textsuperscript{\it cs}.
It is a similar shape in the structure with two ANS molecules and the ATP-binding site inhibitor staurosporine (PDB ID 4EZ7).
This structure also has the crystallisation artefact ethanediol crystallised at the pocket of interest, implying that binding there is possible.

A structure with ethanediol bound at the ANS site and an ATP-binding site inhibitor (PDB ID 4EZ3) appears to have the pocket slightly open.
This indicates that occupation of the ANS site and opening of the pocket of interest are linked, suggesting that if the pocket can be bound then the inactivating motions of the \textalpha C-helix will prevent cyclin binding and inactivate the protein.
The idea is that by stabilising the pocket of interest the inactive state is favoured and activation by cyclin A2 cannot occur.
The hope is that the pocket of interest can accommodate a small molecule ligand, and potentially that it can open further to present more binding interactions.

One risk of targeting this site is that the pocket is small, meaning a limited number of interactions can be made with a ligand.
The pocket is also only available in some states, meaning that there may be an energetic cost to stabilising it \cite{Oleinikovas2016}.
Off site binding may also be a problem - the ATP-binding site and ANS allosteric site present large pockets on CDK2 known to bind small molecules, and a molecule may bind there rather than at the pocket of interest.

CDK2 was examined with available bioinformatics resources.
FTMap \cite{Kozakov2015} and the Fragment Hotspot Map \cite{Radoux2016} sample the protein surface with molecular probes to find fragment binding hotspots.
FTMap \cite{Kozakov2015} does not predict the pocket of interest as a binding site.
The Fragment Hotspot Map \cite{Radoux2016} does not reveal the pocket of interest as a fragment binding site in the default map.
However adjusting the score cutoff does show there is some ability for fragment to bind to the pocket.

ResiCon calculates dynamic regions in proteins by considering contacts between residues \cite{Dziubinski2016}.
ResiCon was run on CDK2.
The pocket of interest seems to be on the edge of dynamic domains across a variety of given numbers of domain outputs, including the default result of two domains.
This indicates that the site could have the ability to cause structural rearrangement in distal parts of the protein by acting as a hinge that responds to ligand binding.
This is further evidenced by examining CDK2 using the DynOmics server \cite{Li2017}.
Residue that are close to the pocket of interest, such as ASP127 in the pocket, are predicted to be hinge residues that control the two slowest normal modes.

PDBFlex finds flexible regions in proteins based on all PDB depositions of the protein \cite{Hrabe2016}.
For CDK2 it indicates that the only real areas of variation in the structure is around the \textalpha C-helix and the T-loop, which is near the pocket of interest.

\subsection{Virtual screening}

A virtual screening approach was carried out to predict compounds that bind to the pocket of interest.
ZINC is a free database of commercially-available compounds for virtual screening \cite{Sterling2015}.
The ZINC12 LeadsNow subset contains over 3 million lead-like molecules in stock at chosen suppliers.
Lead-like molecules have a molecular weight between 250 and 350, an octanol-water partition coefficient not greater than 3.5 and no more than 7 rotatable bonds.
These criteria give smaller and less lipophilic molecules than those that would conventionally end up being drugs, i.e.\ those that fit Lipinski's rule of five \cite{Lipinski2001}.
This is because at the hit stage the priority is finding effective scaffolds with high affinity per atom (ligand efficiency).
Elaboration of the structure with further functional groups generally occurs later and would usually result in the addition of chemical groups, raising the molecular weight.

The LeadsNow subset is clustered using a 90\% Tanimoto cutoff as described at \url{http://zinc.docking.org} to get a representative subset of $\sim$250,000 compounds.
These compounds are docked using AutoDock Vina \cite{Trott2010} with standard settings to the pocket of interest in the ANS-bound structure (PDB ID 3PXF).
Examples of docking poses can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cdk2_structure}E.
The top 2,000 structures by affinity score from this screen were retained for further docking studies.
This was due to the computational cost of virtual screening - the score from AutoDock Vina on the ANS-bound structure was used to eliminate most compounds and the remaining compounds were taken forward for further studies.
The 2,000 retained molecules were docked using AutoDock Vina and DOCK \cite{Allen2015} onto four structures:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The ANS-bound structure, PDB ID 3PXF.
\item The ANS-bound structure with the ATP-binding site inhibitor staurosporine, PDB ID 4EZ7.
\item A structure selected from an ensemble of structures generated from (1) using ExProSE.
The structure selected is the one with the pocket of interest most open.
\item The same as (3) but the ensemble is generated using ExProSE from (2).
\end{enumerate}
The structure of the pocket of interest in each of these structures is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cdk2_structure}C.
Docking to multiple structures means the compounds are scored in multiple conformations of the binding site, which is an approximation of ensemble docking.
This is important in general to take into account the flexibility of binding pockets, and especially important for this pocket as it is a flexible pocket not present in all structures.
Using two different docking algorithms, AutoDock Vina and DOCK, provides two different scores for each structure and goes some way to reducing the inaccuracies of virtual screening.
Compounds were in general better scored for structures (3) and (4), those with the pocket of interest open.
This is to be expected as a larger pocket presents more opportunities for interactions with the ligand.


\subsection{Compound selection}

Compounds were ranked by the average of the 8 scores from the above docking (4 structures, 2 docking methods).
In addition to the lead-like properties described previously, compounds were further filtered to remove compounds that would potentially give erroneous assay results.
Compounds violating various criteria set out by the SwissADME server for assessing medicinal chemistry friendliness \cite{Daina2017}, such as properties of pan-assay interference compounds \cite{Baell2014}, were removed.
Compounds marked as not having benign chemical functionality in ZINC12 were also removed.
Although compounds were clustered by ZINC12 to remove similar compounds, some compounds were relatively similar to each other on visual inspection.
Compounds were hence removed by similarity in ChemMine \cite{Backman2011}.
The top 20 ranked compounds remaining that were available from Enamine (\url{http://www.enamine.net}) were purchased and taken forward for experimental testing.
The structures of the compounds are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:compound_structures}.
Docking scores and compound IDs are shown in Table~\ref{tab:enamine_compounds}.
A search of these structures in the PDB indicates that none are currently ligands in the PDB.
None appear in the ChEMBL database of bioactive drug-like small molecules \cite{Gaulton2017}.

\subsection{Experimental aims}

The main aim of the experimental work was to screen the purchased compounds using the TR-FRET assay and a binding assay to see if the compounds could inhibit the CDK2-cyclin A2 interaction.
This required cyclin A2 to be purified.


\subsection{Purification of cyclin A2}

For optimal TR-FRET signal (see below) it is be beneficial to have a single surface-exposed cysteine labelled with Cy5 dye.
Cyclin A2 has two surface-exposed cysteine residues.
Hence, initial purification was attempted for cyclin A2 residues 169-432 with GST tag and the C327A mutation.
% The other surface-exposed is C193
The GST tag allowed selective separation of the protein during purification.
The His tag could not be used as this was going to be present on CDK2 to bind the donor fluorophore.
This purification resulted in low quantities of soluble protein ($<$ 1 mg from 4 L media) and purity was low, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:purification}A.
Different purification strategies including varying the media, incubation temperature and incubation times were attempted but did not improve yield.

The difficulty of purifying this cyclin A2 mutant led us to try purification of cyclin A2 residues 169-432 with GST tag and no mutation.
This purified more readily than the mutant, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:purification}B.
However the yield was still low (1 mg from 8 L media).
This could be because the cysteine mutation destabilises the protein, increasing its tendency to aggregate.
Concentration of the protein using spin filtration led to loss of the protein.
This, along with the low yield, suggests that cyclin A2-GST is unstable and has a tendency to aggregate and become insoluble \cite{Brown2015}.

Due to the difficulty of purifying cyclin A2-GST, a change was made to the experimental strategy.
The donor and acceptor fluorophores for the TR-FRET assay were switched so that the Eu anti-His antibody was targeted at cyclin A2 and CDK2 was conjugated with Cy5 dye - see later.
This required purification of cyclin A2 residues 169-432 with His tag.
This purification proved considerably more successful than cyclin A2-GST, with 10 mg produced from 4 L media - see Figure~\ref{fig:purification}C.
This indicates that the large GST tag may disrupt the stability or folding of cyclin A2, but the shorter His tag does not have the same effect.
Purified cyclin A2-His was taken forward for the TR-FRET assay.

\end{figure}


\subsection{TR-FRET assay}

This popular assay for drug discovery research is the combination of time-resolved fluorometry with F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) \cite{Comley2006}.
Figure~\ref{fig:tr_fret}A-B outlines the principles of a TR-FRET assay.
FRET involves two fluorophores, a donor and an acceptor.
A time delay between excitation and detection means measurement occurs after the timescale of background fluorescence.
The long emission time of the donor fluorophore means a signal is obtained after the time delay.

CDK2 prepared previously in the lab was labelled with Cy5 dye.
The TR-FRET assay was tested using a titration of CDK2 with constant cyclin A2 and donor fluorophore.
An increase in signal with increasing CDK2 concentration would be expected.
Figure~\ref{fig:tr_fret}C shows the result of this titration.
Whilst there is a higher signal at higher CDK2 concentrations, this trend is also present for the control of cyclin A2-GST.
Cyclin A2-GST lacks the His tag required to bind to the donor fluorophore so should not lead to a TR-FRET signal.
This indicates that the increased signal with CDK2 concentration is likely due to excess, unbound Cy5 dye in the CDK2 solution.
Time constraints meant that a further gel filtration could not be carried out to remove this unbound dye.
The high background signal means the screen would not be effective at finding compounds that inhibit the cyclin A2-CDK2 interaction, so the compounds were not put through the TR-FRET screen.

\begin{figure}

\contcaption{(A) The principle of the TR-FRET assay used.
One protein in the binding pair is covalently-bound to Cy5 dye (the acceptor fluorophore).
The other protein is targeted with an antibody containing the lanthanide Eu (the donor fluorophore).
Light is shone at the excitation wavelength of the donor fluorophore.
This emits at the excitation wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore.
After a delay to allow background emission to recede, emission from the acceptor fluorophore is measured.
(B) If a modulator prevents the proteins interacting, emission from the donor to the acceptor fluorophore is not possible and there is no signal.
After difficulty purifying cyclin A2-GST, the strategy was switched so cyclin A2-His binds the Eu antibody and CDK2 is labelled with the dye.
(C) Results of a CDK2 titration TR-FRET assay.
The TR-FRET signal is shown for two repeats using cyclin A2-His, and for the control cyclin A2-GST which did not show the expected behaviour of a flat signal.}

\subsection{Binding assay}

A binding assay was carried out to test whether the compounds could inhibit the CDK2-cyclin A2 interaction.
Cyclin A2-His and CDK2 were incubated with beads that selectively bind the His tag.
After washing the beads to remove unbound protein only cyclin A2 and proteins bound to it should remain.
In the absence of a PPI inhibitor a signal for CDK2 would be expected in immunoblotting as CDK2 binds to cyclin A2.
This signal would be expected to disappear in the presence of a modulator that prevented the interaction.
This is only a semi-quantitative assay at best and TR-FRET would be much more informative.
However, it was carried out due to time constraints and the difficulties with obtaining results from TR-FRET.

The binding assay results can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:binding_assay} for the 12 compounds it was carried out on.
A problem with the assay was binding of CDK2 to the beads despite the lack of a His tag on CDK2.
This gave a substantial background signal making a signal from the compounds hard to distinguish from the background.
However, some compounds do appear to remove the CDK2 signal at high concentrations.
Compound D at 200 \textmu M and 1 mM, and compound J at 1 mM, cause the CDK2 signal to decrease.
At these concentrations Compounds D and J had solubility issues in the assay.
As the expected background is high the solubility issues are likely the cause of the observed signal rather than genuine PPI inhibition.

{(A) Binding assay results for the 12 compounds tested.
The five bands represent increasing compound concentrations from left to right: 0 M control, 8 \textmu M, 40 \textmu M, 200 \textmu M and 1 mM.
The strength of the band represents the presence of CDK2.
The background signal, in the absence of cyclin A2, is also shown.
This shows non-specific binding of CDK2 to the beads and indicates that a signal in the assay would be hard to distinguish from the background.}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:cdk2_discussion}

The difficulty of purifying cyclin A2 is likely due to the propensity of the protein to aggregate.
This is probably due to large flexibility, a lack of stability in the absence of the binding partner and/or a partially folded state during expression \cite{Grigoroudis2015}.
This is exemplified by the fact that the crystal structure of the CDK2-cyclin A2 complex has only been found for part of the cyclin A2 structure \cite{Jeffrey1995}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cdk2_structure}B.
In addition the full length of human cyclin A2 has not been crystallised in the absence of CDK2, with only the fragment corresponding to residues 171-432 in bovine cyclin A having a structure \cite{Brown1995}.
This is likely due to reasons related to the difficulties in purification.
The presence of the GST tag made the yield from cyclin A2 purification considerably lower than for the His tag.
This could be due to the large GST segment causing problems with folding leading to aggregation in the fusion protein.

Though time constraints meant that no more experiments could be carried out, there are a number of other tests that could be done to probe the allostery at the pocket of interest.
Primarily this would involve further work on the TR-FRET and binding assays to reduce background signal and allow the compounds to be screened.
Other tests that could be carried out include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Thermal shift assay: circular dichroism can be used to measure the unfolding of a protein by observing changes in plane-polarised light.
If a compound bound to CDK2 it may change the temperature at which the protein unfolds.
This assay is comparatively quick and easy but provides limited information.
\item Anti-proliferation assay: adding a compound to cancer cells should stop cell proliferation if the compound completely inhibits CDK2-cyclin A2 interaction.
However this assay does not indicate that the compound is specific to the CDK2-cyclin A2 interaction, as any effect that prevents proliferation will appear in the assay.
\item Mutagenesis: a mutation in the putative binding site of a compound will likely disrupt binding.
If inhibition occurs for the wild-type CDK2 but not for a mutant with a mutation, this gives evidence that the mutation site is the binding site or part of a crucial allosteric communication pathway.
This assumes that the mutation has no other effect on the structure such as destabilisation.
However, the effectiveness of mutagenesis studies to explore allostery has been questioned \cite{Tang2017}.
\item Cyclin E1: another cyclin that binds to CDK2 is cyclin E1.
Carrying out the above experiments with cyclin E1 rather than cyclin A2 would give an idea of the specificity of allosteric modulation of the interaction of CDK2 with cyclins.
Use of the different structures of cyclin A2 and cyclin E1 in complex with CDK2 may also help elucidate the allosteric mechanism \cite{Honda2005}.
\item Bovine cyclin A: bovine cyclin A purifies more readily than the human protein \cite{Brown2015} and this would provide an alternative source to the human protein.
\item Kinase assay: cyclin A2 is required for the activation, and hence kinase activity, of CDK2 \cite{Jeffrey1995}.
Assays that measure the kinase activity in the presence of the compounds indicate whether they are able to prevent CDK2 activation by cyclin A2.
\item Surface plasmon resonance (SPR): one binding partner is immobilised on a surface and the other partner is flowed across it.
The change in mass on the surface due to complex formation leads to a change in the refractive index of the solvent, which can be measured in real time.
SPR is a commonly-used tool to probe binding and would be suitable for the case of CDK2.
\item X-ray crystallography: hit compounds in other screens could be incubated with CDK2 and an attempt could be made at obtaining a crystal.
If successful this would indicate where the compound binds on CDK2 and show conformational changes due to binding.
It would also facilitate further computational studies on the new structure.

\end{itemize}

The difficulty of validating a predicted allosteric site experimentally acts as a deterrent to many groups.
However, the success of computational prediction methods is ultimately determined by whether they can make predictions that are validated experimentally.
In addition, iterative cycles of computational prediction and experimental validation can be used to develop and improve the computational approach, as has been seen recently for protein design applications \cite{Rocklin2017}.
The work in this chapter represents the first steps that would be taken on the path to experimental validation of a predicted site.
As more groups proceed from computational prediction to experimental validation \cite{Brecher2017} it is hoped that the path will become more established and systematic.
