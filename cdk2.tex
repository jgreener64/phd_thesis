\chapter{CDK2}

This chapter describes computational and experimental work to test a potential allosteric site on a protein important in cell cycle regulation, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2).


\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Virtual screening}

ZINC12 LeadsNow subset taken at 90\% Tanimoto similarity ($\sim$250,000 compounds).
Docked to 3PXF with AutoDock vina.
Receptor and ligands prepared in line with the AutoDock vina documentation.
The top 2,000 structures by score (?) from this screen were docked using AutoDock vina and DOCK into four structures:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\section{Results}

Native kind of there (1HCL), ANS-bound there (3PXF), cyclin-bound not there (1FIN), 4EZ3 half open.
PDB - n strucs, nothing bound apart from EDO in 3QQH/4EZ7.
Carried out virtual screening - example of docking pose by vina/DOCK.
